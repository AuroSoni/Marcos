1. "Urgent"  Understand the PCB and library design required for DWM1001 OR order DWM1001Dev. Some ideas:
		i)If a tag knows its position the maybe we can directly connect it with Arduino using I2C or
		  or UART communication. But we would have to develop a library for it which can be really tedious.

2. "Delayed" Figure out how AR viewer would work and its compatiblity.

3. "Urgent"  Modify the library and code for MPU9250 and prepare a simulation to visually analyse the output.
	     The filtering is very very important to us because MPU data determines our bullet trajectory and 
	     even slight deviations can cause landslide effect.

4. "Later"   Figure out Arduino and unity interface.

5. "Later"   ARCore development using Android Studio.

6. "Speculated" Develop a shield for the sensors and give it a shape of a gun using 3D printing.

7. "Progress" Develop a 3D Map of the play area.
